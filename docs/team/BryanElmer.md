## Overview

I was involved in a greenfield project called Fridget. Fridget is a Java-written, CLI-based software that helps users manage all the items in their fridge. Eliminating the need to do things manually, Fridget helps automate processes such as adding, listing, finding items in the fridge.

### Enhancements Implemented

#### New Feature: Added the ability to save all items in Fridget.

- What it does: Allows Fridget to remember all the items in the item list and shopping list before exiting the program.
- Justification: This feature is necessary so that users will not lose their item and shopping lists upon re-entering the program.
- Highlights: All data is stored in separate texts files that can be edited manually for more advanced users. This allow users to transfer data from one instance of the program to another by replacing the data files.

#### New Feature: Added Shopping List in Fridget.

- What it does: Allow users to keep track of items that they want to replenish once they run out.
- Justification: This feature ensures that users will meet their essential needs when necessary without user involvement.
- Highlights:
    - Fridget automatically removes items from the shopping list when they are added into the item list.
    - Fridget will prompt the users to add items into the shopping list only if they run out.
    - Users cannot add and remove items in the shopping list freely as it is done automatically by Fridget.

#### New Feature: Added the ability to reset item list in Fridget.

- What it does: Allow users to clear and start with a new and fresh item list by typing in `reset`.
- Justification: This feature is needed so that users can start with a fresh item list after trying Fridget out for the first time with dummy test data.
