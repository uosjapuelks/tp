## Setting Up Fridget
Refer to User Guide section on [Quick Start](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#:~:text=be%20more%20efficient.-,Quick%20Start,-Ensure%20that%20you).

## Architecture

### Command
![image info](./umlDiagrams/Command.png)
The Command class is inherited by all other command class with their specific functionalities.

The Command class contain an execute() method which is inherited by all other classes to execute the
function specified by their names.

## Design & implementation

### Architecture Components

![image info](./umlDiagrams/Architecture.png)

This diagram illustrates the basic concept that underlies Fridget.

Each rectangle above represents a class that exists to make Fridget work. 
The larger folders represent the main purpose of the classes inside it.
Their functions are as follows:

#### **Front End**

The front end aims to handle:
- Reading <ins>inputs</ins> from the user
- Sending <ins>outputs</ins> to the user

##### `Ui`

The Ui manages the entirety of the front end. 
- It collects user input and stores it.
- It also prints any necessary output to the terminal.

#### **Core**

The core aims to understand and execute the user's commands.

#### `Parser`

The Parser collects information from the user's input in a way that is usable by other classes within Fridget.

#### `IngredientList`

This class keeps track of all items currently stored within Fridget, and can be easily manipulated.

#### `ShoppingList`

This class keeps track of all items the user may want to shop for, and can be easily manipulated.

#### `Command`

There is a Command class for each possible command the user could execute.
Each Command class controls the Ui, Parser, IngredientList, and ShoppingList so the User's intended outcome is achieved.

#### **Database**

The Database stores all info that is needed on a permanent basis. This may
include info such as the contents of IngredientList. Most info in the Database
is stored after any changes, and is usually retrieved when Fridget is turned
on.

#### `Storage`

The Storage class takes charge of storing items after every command, and
retrieving them upon startup.

#### Fridget

#### `Fridget`

Fridget initialises all classes upon startup, and initiates the user feedback loop as shown below.

![image info](./umlDiagrams/UserFeedbackLoop.png)

### Architecture Logic

The overall flow within Fridget occurs in three stages:

- Startup
- Execution
- Shutdown

#### Startup

1. The `main` method in Fridget creates a new instance of `Fridget`.
2. This new instance creates new instances of `Ui`, `Parser`,`IngredientList`, `ShoppingList`, and `Storage`.
3. `Fridget.run()` is called, which asks `Storage` to check stored files in the directory: `fridgetData`.
4. `IngredientList` and `ShoppingList` is updated based on the info obtained.
5. `Fridget.run()` initiates the user feedback loop, to obtain input from the user.

#### Execution

1. The user types in an input into the `Ui`. `Parser` is used to extract a `Command` from the user's input.
2. `Command.execute()` is called to execute the command.
3. The `Command` takes control of the `Ui`, `IngredientList`, and `ShoppingList` to achieve the intended outcome the user requires.
4. Once `Command.execute()` has ceased, the `Ui` awaits further input from the user.

#### Shutdown

1. When the `Ui` receives an input containing `exit`, `Parser` extracts an `ExitCommand`.
2. This `ExitCommand` prints a message to let the user know Fridget is shutting down.
3. `Fridget` recognises that `ExitCommand.exitNotRequired()` is not false, and shuts down Fridget safely.

### Adding Items Into Fridget

#### Main Objectives:

The functionality to add items is bound by two main objectives:
* Make adding items convenient for the user
* Parse enough information about the ingredient to benefit the user in the future

As a result, the current iteration requires two pieces of info from the user:
* The name of the ingredient
* The expiry date of the ingredient

This is done to minimize the input required from the user per entry, while maximising future uses with the data.

Future uses include:
* Finding if an ingredient exists by searching for its name
* Combining ingredients with similar names and expiry together
* Sort all ingredients by expiry date
* Remind users of expiring ingredients by name

#### Overall Sequence:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/AddSequence.png)

Step 1:

This step is almost always initiated by Fridget, but could potentially be done by another class in the future.

Step 2 & 3:

The parseIngredientForAdding() method is called in Parser, with the currentUserInput as a parameter.
The parser returns an Ingredient with the name and expiry date specified in the user input. 

Step 4:

If the user uses the ' | ' character in the ingredient's name, an exception is thrown.
This is done as the ' | ' may confuse the Storage class.

Step 5 & 6:

The Ingredient is added to IngredientList.
IngredientList returns a value signifying the current quantity of Ingredient in IngredientList.

Step 7 & 8:

If the Ingredient already exists in Fridget's IngredientList, print a message with the Ui to signify that the quantity of the existing item has increased to the user.

Step 9 & 10:

If the ingredient does not exist, print a message using Ui to signify to the user that a new Ingredient has been added into Fridget.

Step 11:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Removing Items From Fridget

### Getting Help Manual 

#### Main Objectives:

The objective of a help manual in Fridget is to ensure users are equipped with the basic knowledge to get 
started with Fridget.

The idea behind an inbuilt help manual is to ensure Fridget is convenient and reduce the heavy reference of 
the User Guide.

Future uses include:
* More in-depth coverage of all basic functions.
* Interactive component to explore capabilities of each commands.

#### Sequence of execution:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/HelpSequence.png)

Step 1: 

The execution of the Help Command is initiated by Fridget.

Step 2 & 3: 

The printLine() method is called in the Ui which prints out the String that is input into the method, 
in this case it is the help manual.

Step 4:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Resetting Item List In Fridget

#### Main Objectives:

The objective of the reset functionality is to provide users an easy way to remove all the items in Fridget.

#### Overall Sequence:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/ResetSequence.png)

Step 1: 

The execution of this step is initiated by Fridget.

Step 2 & 3:

The getIngredientList() method is called in the IngredientList, and the current ingredientList is returned.

Step 4:

If returned ingredientList is empty, a FridgetException is thrown and the command exits. Else, it will continue to step 5.

Step 5 & 6: 

If the user double confirms the reset command, the resetList() method is called in the IngredientList and resets 
the ingredient list by overwriting it with a new ingredient list.

Step 7 & 8:

The printResetMessage() method is called in the Ui, and prints a String stating that the ingredient list has been reset.

Step 9:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Listing Items In Fridget

#### Main Objectives:

The functionality to list items is bound by two main objectives:
* Allow users to easily view the contents of Fridget.
* Allow users to choose their preferred sort type.

As a result, the current iteration optionally requires an additional info from the user:
* The sort type of the list.

This additional is optional as the default settings sorts the list by ingredient name.

#### Overall Sequence:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/ListSequence.png)

Step 1:

This step is almost always initiated by Fridget, but could potentially be done by another class in the future.

Step 2 & 3:

The parseSortTypeForList() method is called in Parser, with the currentUserInput as a parameter.
The parser returns a String as sortType with the detected sort type in the user input.

Step 4 & 5:

The getIngredientList() method is called in IngredientList, with the sortType as a parameter.
The IngredientList returns an ArrayList<Ingredient> as listOfIngredients that are sorted according to the sort type.

Step 6 & 7:

The printListMessage() method is called in Ui, with the listOfIngredient, and sortType as parameters.
The Ui prints out the list of Ingredients for the user.

Step 8:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Listing Expiring Items In Fridget
#### Main Objectives:

The functionality to list items is bound by one objective:
* Allow users to easily view all expired or expiring items in Fridget.

The current iteration always lists according to the expiry dates of the items.

The purpose of listing according to expiry date as the item closer to expiry or most expired will be listed first.

#### Overall Sequence:
![image info](./umlDiagrams/ExpiringSequence.png)

Step 1:

This step is initiated by Fridget to initialise ExpiringCommand class.

Step 2:

String "e" is assigned to sortByExpiry.

Step 3 & 4:

The getIngredientList() method is called in IngredientList, with sortByExpiry as a fixed parameter.
The IngredientList returns an ArrayList<Ingredient> as listOfIngredients that are sorted according to expiry dates.

Step 5 & 6:

The printListMessage() method is called in UI, with the listOfIngredient as parameter.
The Ui prints out the list of Expiring Ingredients for the user.

Step 8:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Finding Items In Fridget

#### Main Objectives:

The functionality to find items is bound by two main objectives:
* Allow users to easily find the list of items in Fridget that has similarities to search term.

As a result, the current iteration requires an info from the user:
* The name of the item sought.

This additional info is to be used to be compared to every item in the list.

#### Overall Sequence:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/FindSequence.png)

Step 1:

This step is initiated by Fridget to initialise FindCommand class.

Step 2 & 3:

The getCurrentUserInput() method is called in Ui.
The Ui returns a String as storedInput which is the user input.

Step 4 & 5:

The parseSearchTerm() method is called in Parser, with storedInput and Parser.CommandType.FIND as parameters.
The Parser returns a String as searchTerm.

Step 6 & 7:

The findAllMatchingIngredients() method is called in IngredientList with searchTerm as a parameter.
The IngredientList returns an ArrayList<Ingredient> as matchingIngredients for the user.

Step 8 & 9:

The printListMessage() method is called in Ui, with the matchingIngredients.
The Ui prints out the list of Ingredients for the user.

Step 10:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Listing Items In Shopping List

#### Main Objectives:
The objective of this functionality is to allow users to easily view the contents of the shopping list.

#### Sequence of execution:

![ShopListSequence](./umlDiagrams/ShopListSequence.png)

Step 1:

The execution of this step is initiated by Fridget.

Step 2 & 3:

The getShoppingList() method is called in ShoppingList, and returns the current shoppingList.

Step 4:

If the shoppingList returned in step 3 is empty, a FridgetException is thrown and the command will stop. Else, it will continue to step 5.

Step 5 & 6:

The printListMessage() method is called in Ui, and prints out the list of ingredients in the shoppingList.

Step 7:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


### Configuring Notifications 

#### Main Objectives:

The objective of the notification based on current functionality is to print out a reminder notification 
to remind users to eat healthily and inform them of expiring or expired items.

Current implementation allow users to toggle the notifications on or off, with reminders sent out at intervals of 4 hours.

The purpose of implementing time interval and ability to toggle is to prevent excessive notification printing. 

#### Sequence of execution:

![image info](./umlDiagrams/NotificationSequence.png)

Step 1:

This step is initiated by Fridget to initialise Notification class.

Step 2 & 3:

The printNotification() method is called which will run if notification is turned on and time interval from previous
notification is longer than 4 hours. After satisfying the command, printHealthNotification() and printExpiryNotification()
is executed to print out the notifications. All methods called in these steps are called in Notification.

Step 4:

Health and expiry notification is printed when method is called and a new date and time is recorded into the log file.

Step 5:

This step is initiated by Fridget to run execute() method.

Step 6

If isNotificationOn() is true, the method setNotificationStatus(false), called in Notification class, is executed to set notification status 
to false in order to turn off printing of notification.

Step 7 & 8:

The printLine() method is called in the Ui, to print a message to notify user that notification has been switched off.

Step 9:

If isNotificationOn() is false, the method setNotificationStatus(true), called in Notification class, is executed to set notification status
to true in order to turn on printing of notification.

Step 10 & 11:

The printLine() method is called in the Ui, to print a message to notify user that notification has been switched off.

Step 12:

The execution of the execute() method ends, while notification continues to run until program termination.

Step 4:

The execution of the execute() method ends.


## Product scope
### Target user profile

<b>Tech-savvy Families</b> who cook at home, buy groceries, and own a fridge

### Value proposition

Nowadays, fridges are operated manually. Hence, users need to go through item by item manually to perform any function related to their fridge, for example:
* Figuring out what food is close to expiring 
* Figuring out if they have enough ingredients for a certain recipe 
* Figuring out if they are any recipes that they can make with their ingredients 
* Adding/removing items into/from the fridge and storing it in a ledger
* Find out items that need to be bought soon

This CLI based application hopes to automate a lot of the tasks users have relating to the fridge, for example:
* Automated reminder for items nearing expiry or items requiring replenishment 
* Automated housekeeping: Storing items that are added/removed in a central ledger 
* Automated shopping list: Listing out missing ingredients for meals that users want to cook
